TAKEN DOWN AS PRIVACY POLICY HAS CHANGED.

ANTI-GOOGLE RANT:
TELL YOUR ROOKIE RESEARCHERS TO PROPERLY CITE THE OPEN SOURCE "DICTIONARIES" AND "PHRASE TABLES" USED IN THEIR PUBLISHED NLP PAPERS. NO UNDERPAID GRAD STUDENT WANTS TO MANUALLY CODE DATABASES FOR PEANUTS JUST SO SOME BIG-ASS COMPANY CAN COME ALONG AND CLAIM THEIR WORK AS FAIT ACCOMPLI. MAN UP AND TELL THE BRAINWASHED TECHNOPHILLIC PRESS WHAT'S REALLY INSIDE YOUR NLTK BLACK BOX-- AN INTERNATIONAL SWEATSHOP OF TRANSLATORS AND AN ARMY OF OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTORS. 

TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT DEVELOP IN A VACUUM. GOOGLE TRANSLATE WOULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT THE REVERSE ENGINEERING OF PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE OPEN SOURCE TECHNOLOGY. IT'S TIME FOR THE 99% TO TAKE BACK WHAT'S OURS.
